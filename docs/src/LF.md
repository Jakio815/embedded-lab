# Embedded Programming with LF

The purpose of this lab exercise is to learn to use the [Lingua Franca coordination language](https://lf-lang.org) to program an embedded bare-metal microcontroller, specifically the RPi-Pico on the Pololu robot. You will learn debugging strategies while you create a reusable LED reactor that can be used in other applications to provide information through the robot's LEDs.

**FIXME:** From chapter 2 of 3d edition.
