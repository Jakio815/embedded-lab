# Notes for VM users

If you are using the [pre-configured VM image](https://vm.lf-lang.org/), you need to ensure that it can access the RP2040 on the USB port of the host computer. For more information about configuring VirtualBox to allow this, see [this article](https://www.tecmint.com/enable-usb-in-virtualbox/).
