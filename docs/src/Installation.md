# Installation

**FIXME:** Point to VM.

The labs may also be run directly using a Linux, Mac, or Windows machine, the latter with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). There are four main components that need to be installed (Windows users, see [Windows Installation](./WindowsInstallation.md)):

- [lf-pico](./InstallLFPico.md): The lf-pico repository, which contains the lab exercises and supporting code.
- [Lingua Franca](./InstallLF.md): A coordination language that provides timing, concurrency, and state-machine models. Program logic is written in C.
- [VSCode](./InstallVSCode.md): Visual Studio Code (VSCode or just code), an Integrated Development Environment provided by Microsoft that supports Lingua Franca together with C programming and debugging.
- [Pico Tools](./InstallingPicoTools.md): The Raspberry Pi Pico tools, which include a cross compiler and Software Development Kit (SDK).
