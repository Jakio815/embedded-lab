# Introduction
This series of labs is a targeted effort to create a minimal set of laboratory
exercises designed to exposes students to introductory embedded systems concepts.
The labs however have a focus on cyber physical systems modeling techniques and use
the lingua franca coordination framework as a lightweight concurrency layer and
reactor modeling tool. All code is run on the inexpensive raspberry pi pico ❤️.
