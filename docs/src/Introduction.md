# Introduction
This series of labs exposes students to introductory embedded systems concepts.
The labs focus on cyber physical systems modeling and design.
They use the [Lingua Franca coordination language](https://lf-lang.org) to provide timing, concurrency, and state-machine modeling (via its modal models).
All code is run on an inexpensive Raspberry Pi Pico ❤️.
The labs are designed to be companion exercises for a course based on [Lee and Seshia, _Introduction to Embedded Systems: A Cyber-Physical Systems Approach](https://leeseshia.org), MIT Press, 2017.

## Prerequisites
These exercises assume that students are reasonably familiar with or able to quickly learn:

- programming in C
	- [C introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_intro.php)
- Unix-like command-line tools
	- [bash cheat sheet](https://github.com/RehanSaeed/Bash-Cheat-Sheet)
	- [GitHub git cheat sheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/)
	- [Unix reference card](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/%7Ejoanne/unixRC.pdf)
	- [Command line reference](https://ss64.com)
