# Introduction
This series of labs exposes students to introductory embedded systems concepts.
The labs focus on cyber physical systems modeling and design.
They use the [Lingua Franca coordination language](https://lf-lang.org) to provide timing, concurrency, and state-machine modeling (via its modal models).
All code is run on an inexpensive Raspberry Pi Pico ❤️.
The labs are designed to be companion exercises for a course based on [Lee and Seshia, _Introduction to Embedded Systems: A Cyber-Physical Systems Approach](https://leeseshia.org), MIT Press, 2017.
