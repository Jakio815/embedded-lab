Review [Section 6.5, Line and bump sensors](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J86/6.5) of the [Pololu 3pi+ 2040 robot User's Guide](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J86).


Recall from the [Sensors](./Sensors.md) lab that you used an accelerometer to measure pitch and roll of the robot.  How can you use those measurements to 


**NOTE:** According to [Section 6.5, Line and bump sensors](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J86/6.5) of the [Pololu 3pi+ 2040 robot User's Guide](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J86), it is not practical to use the bump sensors in combination with the line sensors. Hence, in this lab, you will only use the line sensors.
