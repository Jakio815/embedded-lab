# Interfacing with Sensors

The purpose of this exercise is to learn to read sensor values on a microcontroller and to interpret those values. You will read accelerometer data from a device on the Pololu robot, convert the readings to meaningful units, and use the results to estimate the tilt of the surface on which the robot sits. As a side effect, you will gain experience reading a technical datasheet.

**FIXME:** From chapter 3 of 3d edition.
