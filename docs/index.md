# Lf-Pico Labs
A set of labs designed for the raspberry pi pico board.
The labs emphasize cyber physical system (cps) modeling techniques while providing an introduction to embedded systems software development and concepts.

[Lingua Franca](https://www.lf-lang.org/)(lf) is used as a lightweight concurrency layer to provide deterministic, reactor model based design that heavily incorporates timing semantics and constraints.

The introduction labs can be run using a single pico board and later robot control labs utilize the [Pololu 3Pi Robot 2040](https://www.pololu.com/product/5001) to implement an autonomous hill climbing robot.
