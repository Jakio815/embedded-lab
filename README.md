# lf-pico
This repository provides support for Lingua Franca (LF) programs on the Raspberry Pi Pico (RPi-Pico) using the Pico software development kit (pico-sdk). More specifically, it provides support for programming the RPi-Pico on the [Pololu 3pi+ 2040 robot](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J86). 
You can build LF programs and flash them directly onto the RPi-Pico or using a secondary Pico board as a debugger using the [picoprobe](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe) application.
