# Introduction
This series of labs exposes students to introductory embedded systems concepts.
The labs focus on cyber physical systems modeling and design.
They use the [Lingua Franca coordination language](https://lf-lang.org) to provide timing, concurrency, and state-machine modeling (via its modal models),
and low-level programming is in C.
The labs are designed to be companion exercises for a course based on [Lee and Seshia, *Introduction to Embedded Systems: A Cyber-Physical Systems Approach*](https://leeseshia.org), MIT Press, 2017.
The C code runs on a [Raspberry Pi RP2040](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP2040)
on the [Pololu 3pi+ 2040 robot](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J86). 
The same RP2040 microprocessor is also available on the low-cost [Raspberry Pi Pico board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Raspberry_Pi_Pico), but this board does not have the sensors and actuators of the Pololu robot, so you will need the robot to be able to complete all the exercises.
